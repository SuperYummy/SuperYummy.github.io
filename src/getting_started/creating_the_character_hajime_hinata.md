## Creating the Characer Hajime Hinata
Characters are what roleplayers can play. Since we created the Beach location, we can now create a character there. Characters begin as entities, so we will create an entity first

1. Enter the command **/world**

2. Press **Collections**

3. The first page has the **Entities** section. Press its button

4. Entities are options that appear in locations. Press **Create**

6. This creates a default entity called **New Entity**. Don't worry about all the options. We will edit this entity to become **Hajime Hinata**. Press **Edit**
