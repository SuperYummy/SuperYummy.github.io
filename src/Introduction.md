## Introduction

Welcome to *World*, a guide about creating a roleplay world

This guide will bring your roleplay world to life on Discord. You can create an experience where stories grow naturally through player interaction


## Who World Is For
World is for creators who want to build location based worlds. This means characters exist in their location and they can interact with whatever is around them

It is also for those who enjoy visual novel style storytelling, such as branching dialogue. If you like tools like RPG Maker, you will feel right using it. Roleplay is inspired by how RPG Maker structures worlds, events, and player movement
